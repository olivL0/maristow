            <p>The Estate runs from the Northern edge of Plymouth to beyond Princetown, and from the Tavy Estuary to beyond Shaugh Prior.</p>
            <p>Maristow surrounds Milton Combe, Bickleigh, Shaugh Prior, Walkhampton,  and Meavy villages and used to also contain Roborough, Horrabridge, and Dousland. The vast majority of the properties have been sold and the inhabitants are largely unaware of the Estateâ€™s existence.</p>
            <p>The Estate is a predominantly traditional rural estate with most of the income coming from dairy farming, let farms and forestry. Income from field sports, golf, commercial and residential letting has grown materially over the last 30 years and now balances the traditional income providing protection from the volatility of those markets.</p>
            <p>The Lopes family acquired the core of Maristow Estate in 1798 from the Heywoods and have since added parts of the Buckland, Sheepstor, and Warleigh estates as well as other acquisitions. The estate has also receded from time to time, particularly with the 1900 sale of around 6,000 acres to the City of Plymouth for Burrator reservoir.</p>
