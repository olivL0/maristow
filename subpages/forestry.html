            <p>We calculate that around 25% of the low lying ground is currently forested but 5% or less of the uplands. We are attempting to get permission to plant extensively on those uplands with a target of reaching 65% tree cover. We anticipate that the Woodland Carbon Code will provide a suitable incentive structure to allow this to happen.</p>
            <p>The Estate leases 700 acres to the Forestry Commission on a long term lease, the bulk of which is growing commercial species.</p>
            <p>Maristow also has around 1,500 acres of in hand woodland and forestry, most of which is native broadleaves such as Oak and Beech. This is managed commercially in order to strike the right balance between mature and growing trees.</p>
