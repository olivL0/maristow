        <p>Maristow Home Farms runs a herd of 780 milking cows over around 2,500 acres. These are split into three herds, two spring calving (Bickham and Natts) and one autumn calving (Galleys). Milk is sold to Arla and Saputo for manufacturing given the high butter fat content.</p>
        <p>The farm employs 10 people full time and is always keen to meet potential new additions to the team. 8 of the team live in estate accommodation.</p>
